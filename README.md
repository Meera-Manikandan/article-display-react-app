## Reflection

This was a 4 hour tech skill assesment project . I had completed this project iteratively. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate framework code. Then tried to simulate data retervial call to swapi API , Once it is working next integration work with jsonplaceholder API implemented

Project goals included using technologies known up until this point and showcasing the ReactJS skills to assessment panel.
